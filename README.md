This application website allows users to create simple laser cutting toolpaths for things like box creation, gear generating, and image tracing. It is designed to output color coded svg files that should be ready to upload directly to your laser cutter. Additionally, it uses a database to keep track of previously created toolpaths so that you can cut them again on-demand.
